# North West Digital Communities

This one-page site gives a focal point for the North West Digital Community.

Groups who want to advertise their groups on the NWDC.org.uk site should 
raise an issue with the details of your group and the e-mail address of 
someone who should be able to post to the announce-only group. Please only
create this issue for groups who are having regular meetings in the North 
West region of the UK.
